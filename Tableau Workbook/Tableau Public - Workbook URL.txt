PLEASE READ BEFORE REVIEWING THE TABLEAU WORKBOOK: 
When you click on the below link to access the Tableau Public workbook, the screen may not load, however, if you refresh it, you will see the first visual but the other tabs will not load from this view. Therefore, to view the work, please scroll to the bottom of the visual and click on the expanded screen icon to view in full screen. You will then be able to navigate and see the full project, if any of the tabs do not load, try clicking onto another tab and go back again. If for any reason, this does not work for you, please open the twbx file in the Tableau Workbook directory and leave it for approximately minutes before reviewing this challenge.
